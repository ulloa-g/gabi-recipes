    <h2>Time spent</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prep time: 10mins</li>
        <li>Cook time: 20mins</li>
        <li>Total time: 30mins</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>8 oz. pasta*</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper (or to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    *Use any short shape pasta.
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Zest and juice the lemon. You'll need about ½ tsp zest and 1 Tbsp lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes, or until tender). Before draining, reserve about 1 cup of the starchy water from the pot.</li>
        <li>Place the frozen peas in the colander before draining the pasta so the pasta will thaw the peas as it drains.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and minced garlic to a large skillet and sauté over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the drained pasta and peas, and about ½ cup of the starchy pasta cooking water to the skillet with the butter and garlic. Stir to combine, then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the ricotta, Parmesan, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and ½ teaspoon lemon zest to the skillet. Stir until everything is well combined, the residual heat from the skillet and pasta have warmed the ricotta, and the ricotta has formed a creamy sauce. Add more of the warm reserved pasta water if needed.</li>
        <li>Season the pasta with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
